# use key f: for initial fixed transform and e: for final fixed transform
# for joints, just use joint number as 1: 2: etc.
notation: [a, alpha, theta, r]
joint:

    1: [0, pi, q1, -r1]
    2: [r2, pi/2, q2, 0]
    3: [r3, 0, pi/2+q3, 0]
    4: [r4, -pi/2, q4, -r5]
    5: [0, pi/2, q5, 0]
    6: [0, -pi/2, q6, 0]
    e: [0, pi, 0, r6]
