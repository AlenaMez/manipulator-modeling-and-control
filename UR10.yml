# use key f: for initial fixed transform and e: for final fixed transform
# for joints, just use joint number as 1: 2: etc.
notation: [a, alpha, theta, r]
joint:
    1: [0, 0, q1, r1]
    2: [0, -pi/2, q2, r4]
    3: [r2, 0, q3, 0]
    4: [r3, 0, q4, 0]
    5: [0, -pi/2, q5-pi,r5]
    6: [0, -pi/2, q6, 0]
    e: [0, 0, 0, r6]
